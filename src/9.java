/*
	 * You are given a lot of cuboid boxes with different length, breadth and
	 * height. You need to find the maximum subset which can fit into each
	 * other.
	 * 
	 * For example: If Box A has LBH as 7 8 9 If Box B has LBH as 5 6 8 If Box C
	 * has LBH as 5 8 7 If Box D has LBH as 4 4 4
	 * 
	 * then answer is A,B,D
	 * 
	 * A box can fit into another only and only if all dimensions of that is
	 * less than the bigger box. Also Rotation of boxes is not possible.
