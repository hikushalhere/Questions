/**
 * You're trying to get to Truthtown. You come to a fork in the road. One road leads to Truthtown 
 * (where everyone tells the truth), the other to Liartown (where everyone lies). At the fork is 
 * a man from one of those towns -- but which one? You get to ask him one question to discover the way. 
 * What's the question?
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * To find the way to Truthtown, simply ask the man, "Which way is your hometown?" Then go whichever way he points:
 *  if he's from Liartown, he'll point to Truthtown and if he's from Truthtown, well, you get it.
