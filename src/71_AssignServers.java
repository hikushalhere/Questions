/**
 * There are at most eight servers in a data center. Each server has got a
 * capacity/memory limit. There can be at most 8 tasks that need to be scheduled
 * on those servers. Each task requires certain capacity/memory to run, and each
 * server can handle multiple tasks as long as the capacity limit is not hit.
 * Write a program to see if all of the given tasks can be scheduled or not on
 * the servers?
 * 
 * Ex: Servers capacity limits: 8, 16, 8, 32 Tasks capacity needs: 18, 4, 8, 4,
 * 6, 6, 8, 8 For this example, the program should say 'true'.
 * 
 * Ex2: Server capacity limits: 1, 3 Task capacity needs: 4 For this example,
 * program should return false.
