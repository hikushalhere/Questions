/**
	 * How will you test a function that generates random numbers?
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * The best way to test this is to write a script that tracks the
	 * distribution of "random" numbers generated. e.g. we can shuffle a deck of
	 * cards n times and can check how similar the n shuffled decks are. or we
	 * can generate numbers 1 to n, n times each number should be generated
	 * approximately only once.
